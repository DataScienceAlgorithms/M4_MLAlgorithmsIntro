    "At a high level, machine learning is building and using models that are learned from data. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence, and it greatly overlaps with data mining. Let's see the \"unofficial\" definitions for these areas from Wikipedia:\n",

It is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science. The overall goal of the data mining process is to extract information from a data set and transform it into an understandable structure for further use.\n",

    "### Training\n",
    "As an example, suppose you are trying to teach someone (say a student) who has no notion of a cat or dog, the concept of cat vs. dog. You might first show the student some pictures of cats and say, \"these are cats\". Then you might show the person some pictures of dogs and say, \"these are dogs\". The set of cat and dog images is called the *training set*, a set of labeled examples (e.g. *instances*). For example, consider the following cat vs. dog training set:\n",

    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataScienceAlgorithms/M4_MLAlgorithmsIntro/main/figures/cat_dog_training.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The student is going to look at different attributes of the image to try to learn a model of cat and a model of a dog. In doing so, the student will identify some aspects (AKA *attributes* or *features*) of the examples that distinguish a cat vs a dog. The features might include:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Feature|Cat value|Dog value|\n",
    "|-|-|-|\n",
    "|Tongue out|No|Yes|\n",
    "|Fur color|Light|Dark|\n",
    "|Ears up|Yes|No|\n",

    "What other features did you come up with?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Building a Model\n",
    "A model to represent cat vs. dog based on these features might be rule-based:\n",
    "\n",
    ">if tongue is out and the fur is dark and the ears are down then this is a dog\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see later how we can use a tree with a rules (like the above) as a model to represent a classification such as dog vs. cat!\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on the above features, this image has the tongue out (dog), light fur color (cat), and ears up (cat). Thus our student would likely classify this image as a cat. But wait! We (the expert supervisors) know this is a dog (a puppy, but a dog none the less). Our training set didn't include any images that were as borderline cat/dog as this testing example. As you can see, the examples that comprise your training set and the features that are utilized greatly impact the accuracy of the learner, and consequently the model that is built. "
